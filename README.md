# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description
The goal of this assignment is to refactor this site to be more accessible and easier to navigate. The code needs to be cleaned up to be more organized, without changing the way it functions. The CSS should be reorganized to match the layout and order of the HTML. CSS Selectors need to be consolidated to be more semantic to the HTML. Web Accessiblity is also becoming more important for companies to utilize.  Therefore, accessibility features need to be added to the site to make it easier for people with disabilities to access and be able to utilize captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
